# Release v1.0.0 - LUFS Normalization and Watch Mode

**First major release with modern audio normalization features!** üéâ

## üéØ Major New Features

### LUFS Normalization
- **ITU-R BS.1770-4 compliant** perceptual loudness measurement
- K-weighting filters for accurate human hearing simulation
- Smart gating with percentile-based block filtering
- Peak limiting to prevent clipping
- Ready for streaming platforms:
  - **Spotify**: `-L -14` LUFS
  - **YouTube**: `-L -13` LUFS  
  - **Broadcast (EBU R128)**: `-L -23` LUFS

### Watch Mode
- **Automated folder monitoring** for unattended processing
- Drop files into watch folder, get normalized output automatically
- Perfect for recording studios, podcasts, and batch workflows
- Graceful handling of locked files and conflict resolution
- Continuous operation until stopped with Ctrl+C

### Example Commands

```batch
# LUFS normalization
normalize -L -14 *.wav              # Spotify standard
normalize -L -23 *.wav              # Broadcast standard
normalize -L -16 -g 95 *.wav        # Ignore loudest 5% of blocks
normalize -L -14 -m 98 *.wav        # LUFS with peak limiting

# Watch mode (automated processing)
normalize -L -14 -m 99 -w C:\incoming -O C:\processed
normalize -m 95 -w "Drop Files Here" -O "Done"
normalize -L -16 -g 95 -w input -O output -q
```
